reflections:
What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
--I would have set my expectations lower to make sure i will have minimum viable product.

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
-- implementing delete and put methods were a little complicated because i forgot that html doesn't support delete and put methods

What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?
-- I would change the styling and maybe add login and registration feature.

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
-- Time management and setting minimum expectations rather than setting them too high and then getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of time it takes to implement all of that.
